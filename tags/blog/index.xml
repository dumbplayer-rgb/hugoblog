      <description>&lt;p&gt;The first post on this blog I wanted to focus on how I made it and how long it took. I rarely code websites so I watched my go to YouTuber for stuff like this. Network Chuck who had an amazing video for making a blog with obsidian, Hugo and Hostinger (I used Netlify because it&amp;rsquo;s free up to a certain point of visits).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I wanted a blog to write all of my ideas and complaints about things and the comanys behind them. So I did some googling on the easiest way to make a blog and came across a video by a man named Chuck Keith on the YouTube channel NetworkChuck &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnE7c0ELEH8&amp;amp;t=1929s%22&#34;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnE7c0ELEH8&amp;t=1929s&#34;&lt;/a&gt; that went through making a blog with obsidian and a ultimate script to move the obsidian files to the website directory and push it to github so Netlify builds and deploys it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
